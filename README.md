# Project Name

The project is focused on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using random forest regression.

## Project Structure

The project has three main folders:

- `data`: This folder contains the raw data and the clean data used for training and testing the model.

- `notebooks`: This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used to develop and test the model.

- `results`: This folder contains the final report in PDF format and the clean data files used for training and testing the model.

The following files are included in the project:

- `churn_clean.csv`: This is the clean data file containing the data used for training and testing the model.

- `rf_clean.csv`, `rf_train.csv`, and `rf_test.csv`: These are the clean data files used for training and testing the random forest regression model.

- `telecom_churn_prediction.ipynb`: This is the Jupyter notebook used to develop and test the model.

- `Telecom Churn Prediction Report.pdf`: This is the final report detailing the analysis and results of the project.

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `telecom_churn_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the model.
